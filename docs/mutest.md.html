**µTest — A small C testing library**

## What is µTest?

µTest aims to be a small unit testing library for C projects, with an API
heavily modelled on high level [Behavior-Driven Development][bdd] frameworks
like [Jasmine][jasmine] or [Mocha][mocha].

[bdd]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development
[jasmine]: https://jasmine.github.io/
[mocha]: https://mochajs.org/

## Adding µTest to your project

The preferred way to use µTest is to include it in your own projects using
a Git sub-module, and then building µTest as a static library. If you are
using [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com), you can use a wrap file in the
`subprojects` directory:

```
[wrap-git]
directory=mutest
url=https://github.com/ebassi/mutest.git
revision=master
```

and then use the `fallback` dependency type:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mutest_dep = dependency('mutest-1',
  fallback: [ 'mutest', 'mutest_dep' ],
  default_options: ['static=true'],
  required: false,
  disabler: true,
)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! Note
    The `static` option will build µTest as an uninstalled static library.
    You can remove the `default_options` argument to get an installed
    shared library.

µTest can also build a shared library and a [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)
file to describe the necessary compiler and linker flags, if you want to
install µTest in your library path; if you decide to depend on the shared
library, you can use the normal `pkg-config`-based dependency discovery.
For instance, if you are using [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com):

```meson
mutest_dep = dependency('mutest-1')
```

And if you're using Autotools:

```m4
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(MUTEST, [mutest-1])
AC_SUBST(MUTEST_CFLAGS)
AC_SUBST(MUTEST_LIBS)
```

## Writing tests using µTest

Writing a test program using µTest requires initializing the test framework,
defining the various tests, and gathering the results. For convenience, µTest
provides a simple macro meant to replace the `main` entry point of any C
binary:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MUTEST_MAIN (
  // your code goes here
)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `MUTEST_MAIN` macro will initialize µTest and print the report.

Each µTest-based test starts from a *suite*, which is created by calling
`mutest_describe()` in the main entry point of your test binary:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MUTEST_MAIN (
  mutest_describe ("A test suite", main_suite);
)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A test binary can have multiple suites.

The purpose of the `main_suite()` function is to create a *specification*,
or *spec*. A spec describes an aspect of your data type, service, or API.
Each spec is made of various expectations, which are defined by calling
`mutest_it()`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
static void
main_suite (void)
{
  mutest_it ("is made of at least one spec", first_spec);
  mutest_it ("can contain multiple specs", second_spec);
  mutest_it ("can have specs that can be skipped", skipped_spec);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you can see, the description of suites and specs tries to match a
natural language description of what the suite is about, and what aspect
of the API is covered by each spec. The descriptions will be logged in
the test output.

Inside each spec we have *expectations* that must be satisfied, in order
to say that the test suite is successful. An expectation is made of
three parts:

 - a description of the expectation
 - the value we are testing
 - a *matcher function*, which will compare the value we are testing
   with the expected value

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
static void
first_spec (void)
{
  bool a = true;

  mutest_expect ("a to be true", mutest_bool_value (a),
                 mutest_to_be, true, NULL);
  mutest_expect ("a not to be false", mutest_bool_value (a),
                 mutest_not, mutest_to_be, false,
                 NULL);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Expectations can chain multiple matching functions in order to
create multiple conditions that must be all satisfied:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
static void
second_spec (void)
{
  // The get_greeting() function is defined elsewhere, and
  // we are testing its output
  const char *str = get_greeting ();

  mutest_expect ("get_greeting() to return all parts of a greeting",
                 mutest_string_value (str),
                 mutest_to_start_with_string, "hello",
                 mutest_to_contain, ",",
                 mutest_to_end_with_string, "world",
                 NULL);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the example above, the expectation will only be satisfied if all three
matchers are successful.

Expectations can be programmatically skipped. For instance, if you haven't
implemented some functionality, yet. These expectations will be satisfied,
but still logged not as successes:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
static void
skipped_spec (void)
{
  // The get_answer() function is defined elsewhere
  int answer = get_answer ();

  mutest_expect ("an answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything",
                 mutest_int_value (answer),
                 mutest_skip, "Deep Thought hasn't finished yet",
                 NULL);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the example above, the `skipped_spec()` specification will succeed, but
it will be marked as skipped.

## Output formats

By default, µTest uses an output similar to Mocha:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ ./test-suite

  A test suite
    is made of at least one spec
      ✓ a to be true
      ✓ a not to be false

      2 passing (80.0 µs)

    can contain multiple specs
      ✓ get_greeting() to return all parts of a greeting

      1 passing (60.0 µs)

    can have specs that can be skipped
      - an answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything

      0 passing (34.0 µs)
      1 skipped

Total
3 passing (202.0 µs)
1 skipped
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additionally, µTest supports [TAP](https://testanything.org/)—Test Anything
Protocol. If you have a TAP harness, like [prove(1)](https://linux.die.net/man/1/prove),
you can use the `MUTEST_OUTPUT` environment variable set to `tap` in order to
get a TAP output:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ MUTEST_OUTPUT=tap ./test-suite
# A test suite
# is made of at least one spec
ok 1 - a to be true
ok 2 - a not to be false
# can contain multiple specs
ok 3 - get_greeting() to return all parts of a greeting
# can have specs that can be skipped
ok 4 - an answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything # SKIP: Deep Thought hasn't finished yet
1..4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
