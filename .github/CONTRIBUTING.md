# Contributing to µTest

The development of µTest is volunteer driven, so if you found a bug, or if
you want to add a new feature, you should follow these steps:

 * Fork the [ebassi/mutest](https://github.com/ebassi/mutest.git)
   repository
 * Work on the code and open a [pull request](https://github.com/ebassi/mutest/pulls)
 * Wait for feedback, code reviews
 * Celebrate when your code gets merged

That's pretty much it.
